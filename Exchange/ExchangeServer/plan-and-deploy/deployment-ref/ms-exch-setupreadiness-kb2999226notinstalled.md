# Update for Universal C Runtime in Windows (KB2999226) not installed

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 setup can't continue because the local computer requires a software update. You need to install this update before Exchange 2016 setup can continue.

Exchange 2016 (for September 2021 CU and later versions) requires the **Update for Universal C Runtime in Windows (KB2999226)** to be installed on the computer before installation can continue.

1. Download and install: [Universal C Runtime in Windows (KB2999226)](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)
2. Select **retry** on the **Readiness Checks page**.

> [!NOTE]
> If this update requires a reboot to complete installation, you'll need to exit Exchange 2016 setup, reboot, and then start setup again.

**Having problems?** Ask for help in the Exchange forums. Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/home?category=exchangeserver).
