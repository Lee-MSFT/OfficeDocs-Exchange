<sup>1</sup> The table indicates if the client works with the server. It does not mean the clients are included in the purchase of these servers. <br/>
<sup>3</sup> Some third-party web parts and add-ins may not be available.<br/>
<sup>4</sup> Requires an Exchange Online Archiving subscription for each on-premises mailbox user that has a cloud-based archive. <br/>
<sup>5</sup> BitLocker drive encryption is supported for Exchange Server, but an administrator needs to enable the feature. <br/>
<sup>6</sup> Windows Server AD RMS is an on-premises server that must be purchased and managed separately in order to enable the supported IRM features. <br/>
<sup>7</sup> Supported for customers running Exchange Server 2013 or later on-premises customers who purchase Azure Information Protection. Microsoft Purview Message Encryption requires on-premises customers to route email through Exchange Online, either by using Exchange Online Protection for email filtering, or by establishing hybrid mail flow.<br/>
<sup>8</sup> Transport rules are made up of flexible criteria, which allow you to define conditions and exceptions, and actions to take based on the criteria. <br/>
<sup>9</sup> For Exchange 2013, DLP requires an Exchange Enterprise Client Access License (CAL). <br/>
<sup>10</sup> Customers running Exchange Server 2013 or later need to download and install the latest cumulative update (CU) or the immediately previous CU, to access Document Fingerprinting and Policy Tips in OWA and OWA for Devices. <br/>
<sup>11</sup> SharePoint Server must be deployed in the on-premises Exchange organization. <br/>
<sup>12</sup> Cloud Voicemail works with Exchange Online and Exchange 2019. See [Plan Cloud Voicemail service for on-premises users - Skype for Business Hybrid | Microsoft Docs](/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-cloud-voicemail). <br/>
