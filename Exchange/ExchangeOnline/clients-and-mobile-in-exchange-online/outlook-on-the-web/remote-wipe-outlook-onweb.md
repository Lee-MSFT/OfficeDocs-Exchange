# How to use Outlook on the web (formerly know as Outlook Web App) and the new Outlook for Windows to remotely wipe an ActiveSync device in Microsoft 365

## Introduction

This article describes how to use Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App OWA) and the new Outlook for Windows to remotely wipe a mobile device in Microsoft 365.

To remotely wipe a mobile device in Outlook on the web or the new Outlook for Windows, the mobile device must be connected to Exchange Online by using Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. If you lose the mobile device, you can use the remote wiping feature to prevent someone from obtaining your personal information from the device.

## Procedure

To remotely wipe a device by using Outlook Web App or Outlook on the web, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 portal.
2. Click **Mail**.
3. Click **Settings**, and then click **Options**.
4. In the left navigation pane, click **Phone**.
5. Select the device that you want to wipe.
6. Click **Wipe Device**, and then click **Yes** when you're prompted.
7. When the wipe operation is completed, you should remove the device completely. To do this, click **Delete**, and then click **Yes** when you're prompted.
