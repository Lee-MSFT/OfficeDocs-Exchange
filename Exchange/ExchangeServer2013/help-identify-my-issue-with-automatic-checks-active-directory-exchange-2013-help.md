# Help Identify My Issue with Automatic Checks - Active Directory

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The check(s) on this page will help identify some of the most common configuration challenges. You can use the automatic check(s) below to validate your configuration and help you update your environment..

If you already have an user account, select **Sign In**. You don't need an Azure ID account. You might be asked for a user account again when the checks run. If so, your user account is in the format of _user name_@_yourFQDN_ and your password.
