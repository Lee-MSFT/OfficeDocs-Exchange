# Help Identify My Issue with Automatic Checks - Directory Synchronization

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

You can use the automatic checks below to validate your configuration and help you update your environment.

If you already have an user account, select Sign In. You don't need an Azure ID account. You might be asked for a user account again when the checks run. If so, your user account is in the format of _user name_@_yourFQDN_ and your password.

> [!NOTE]
> If you receive sync warning messages in the Microsoft 365 admin center, errors in the synchronization server event logs, or unhealthy directory synchronization notification emails from Microsoft Online Services, you may be having some kind of directory synchronization issue. The [Directory Synchronization Troubleshooter](https://aka.ms/dsup) is a Web-based diagnostic tool designed to help identify common types of synchronization failures and prescribe targeted solutions to any issues found. The Directory Synchronization Troubleshooter must be run on the DirSync server.
