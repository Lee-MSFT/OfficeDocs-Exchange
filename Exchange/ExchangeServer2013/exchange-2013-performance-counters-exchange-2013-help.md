# Exchange 2013 Performance Counters

_**Applies to:** Exchange Server 2013_

The following sections list helpful performance counters you can use when troubleshooting Exchange 2013 performance issues.

## Exchange Domain Controller Connectivity Counters

The following tables displays acceptable thresholds and information about Exchange domain controller connectivity counters.

|Counter|Description|Threshold|
|---|---|---|
|MSExchange ADAccess Domain Controllers(\*)\LDAP Read Time|Shows the time in milliseconds (ms) to send an LDAP read request to the specified domain controller and receive a response.|Should be below 50 ms on average. Spikes (maximum values) shouldn't be higher than 100 ms.|
|MSExchange ADAccess Domain Controllers(\*)\LDAP Search Time|Shows the time (in ms) to send an LDAP search request and receive a response.|Should be below 50 ms on average. Spikes (maximum values) shouldn't be higher than 100 ms.|
|MSExchange ADAccess Processes(\*)\LDAP Read Time|Shows the time (in ms) to send an LDAP read request to the specified domain controller and receive a response.|Should be below 50 ms on average. Spikes (maximum values) shouldn't be higher than 100 ms.|
|MSExchange ADAccess Processes(\*)\LDAP Search Time|Shows the time (in ms) to send an LDAP search request and receive a response.|Should be below 50 ms on average. Spikes (maximum values) shouldn't be higher than 100 ms.|

## Processor and Process Counters

The following tables displays acceptable thresholds and information about processors and process counters.

|Counter|Description|Threshold|
|---|---|---|
|Processor(\_Total)\% Processor Time|Shows the percentage of time that the processor is executing application or operating system processes. This is when the processor isn't idle.|Should be less than 75% on average.|
|Processor(\_Total)\% User Time|Shows the percentage of processor time spent in user mode. User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems.|Should be less than 75% on average.|
|Processor(\_Total)\% Privileged Time|Shows the percentage of processor time spent in privileged mode. Privileged mode is a processing mode designed for operating system components and hardware-manipulating drivers. It allows direct access to hardware and all memory.|Should be less than 75% on average.|
|System\Processor Queue Length (all instances)|Indicates the number of threads each processor is servicing. Processor Queue Length can be used to identify if processor contention or high CPU utilization is caused by the processor capacity being insufficient to handle the workloads assigned to it. Processor Queue Length shows the number of threads that are delayed in the Processor Ready Queue and are waiting to be scheduled for execution. The value listed is the last observed value at the time the measurement was taken.|Shouldn't be greater than 5 per processor.|
|Process(\*)\% Processor Time|Can be used to identify specific processes consuming CPU.|Not applicable|

## Memory Counters

The following tables displays acceptable thresholds and information about memory counters.

|Counter|Description|Threshold|
|---|---|---|
|Memory\Available Mbytes|Shows the amount of physical memory, in megabytes (MB), immediately available for allocation to a process or for system use. It's equal to the sum of memory assigned to the standby (cached), free, and zero page lists. For a full explanation of the memory manager, refer to Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) or "System Performance and Troubleshooting Guide" in the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit.|Should remain above 5% of total RAM.|
|Memory\% Committed Bytes In Use|Shows the ratio of Memory\Committed Bytes to the Memory\Commit Limit. Committed memory is the physical memory in use for which space has been reserved in the paging file should it need to be written to disk. The commit limit is determined by the size of the paging file. If the paging file is enlarged, the commit limit increases, and the ratio is reduced. This counter displays the current percentage value only; it isn't an average.|If this value is more than 80%, it is an indication that the system is likely under stress to provide more memory.|

## .NET Framework Counters

The following tables displays acceptable thresholds and information about .NET Framework counters.

|Counter|Description|Threshold|
|---|---|---|
|.NET CLR Memory(\*)\% Time in GC|Shows when garbage collection has occurred. When the counter exceeds the threshold, it indicates that CPU is cleaning up and isn't being used efficiently for load. Adding memory to the server would improve this situation.|Should be below 10% on average.|
|.NET CLR Exceptions(\*)\# of Exceps Thrown / sec|Displays the number of exceptions thrown per second. These include both .NET Framework exceptions and unmanaged exceptions that get converted into .NET Framework exceptions. For example, the null pointer reference exception in unmanaged code would get thrown again in managed code as a .NET Framework System.NullReferenceException. This counter includes both handled and unhandled exceptions.|Should be less than 5% of total requests per second (RPS) (Web Server(\_Total)\Connection Attempts/sec * .05).|
|.NET CLR Memory(\*)\# Bytes in all Heaps|Shows the sum of four other counters: Gen 0 Heap Size, Gen 1 Heap Size, Gen 2 Heap Size, and Large Object Heap Size. This counter indicates the current memory allocated in bytes on the GC Heaps.|Not applicable|

|Counter|Description|Threshold|

|TCPv6\Connection Failures|Shows the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from the SYN-SENT state or the SYN-RCVD state, plus the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the LISTEN state from the SYN-RCVD state.|An increasing number of failures, or a consistently increasing rate of failures, can indicate a bandwidth shortage.|
|TCPv4\Connections Reset|Shows the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from either the ESTABLISHED state or the CLOSE-WAIT state.|An increasing number of resets, or a consistently increasing rate of resets, can indicate a bandwidth shortage.|
|TCPv6\Connections Reset|Shows the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from either the ESTABLISHED state or the CLOSE-WAIT state.|An increasing number of resets, or a consistently increasing rate of resets, can indicate a bandwidth shortage.|
